## About me
I am 22 years old and I work as an accountant. In my current job, I don't like that you have to do a repetitive job every month. I want to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development and work as developer in future. In my opinion, working as front-end developmer, it is necessary to solve many different tasks that require not only a mathematical, technical and logical approach, but also a creative one.
### My strengths:
* goal-oriented
* a team-player
* responsible and hard-working

## Skills
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git/GitHub (Basic)
* VS Code

## Code Examples
**KATA from CODEWARS: Unique In Order:**
*Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.*
```
var uniqueInOrder=function(iterable){
  let arr = Array.isArray(iterable) ? iterable : iterable.split('');
  function reducer(uniqueArr, currentVal) {
    if (uniqueArr[uniqueArr.length -1] !== currentVal) {
      uniqueArr.push(currentVal);
    }
    return uniqueArr;
  }
  let unique = arr.reduce(reducer, []);
  return unique;
}
```
